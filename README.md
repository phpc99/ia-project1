# Cogito
Cogito is a nice little puzzle game for Windows in which you must use the vertical and horizontal levers to arrange the pieces to match the given pattern.

Heuristics: Number of pieces outside of the objective position or using the Manhattan Distance (computed by counting the number of moves along the grid that each tile is displaced from its goal position, and summing these values over all tiles).

# How to compile
Make sure you are in the CogitoGame folder then run the command _python main.py_
